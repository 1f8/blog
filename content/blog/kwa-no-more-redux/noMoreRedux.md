## Redux Alternatives

In this blog, I'll be discussing why I prefer to move away from redux and alternatives.

Blog entry coming soon :)

> I consistently see developers putting all of their state into redux. Not just global application state, but local state as well. This leads to a lot of problems, not the least of which is that when you're maintaining any state interaction, it involves interacting with reducers, action creators/types, and dispatch calls, which ultimately results in having to open many files and trace through the code in your head to figure out what's happening and what impact it has on the rest of the codebase.
